Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the trending and most promising branch of artificial intelligence. This work has been conducted in a six months inernship. It holds on a study of reinforcement learning algorithms on two environments: CartPole and MountainCar.
This project contains:
-a jupyter notebook of the training and rollout implementations.
-a heatmap video showing the evolution of learning in MountainCar environment using DQN.
-a package for the customized Cart-Pole gym environment.
